(a) IntQueue1:
	AF: For a given IntQueue1 q1, a linked-list entries stores all the integers in the
		queue. The first element in the list is the least recently added one and the last
		element in the list is the last element added to the queue.
	RI: The linked-list entries can't not be null
	
	IntQueue2:
	AF: For a given IntQueue2 q2, a circular array stores all the integers in the queue.
		The front stores the index of the least recently added element and the size keeps
		track of the size of the queue.
	RI: The array entries cannot be null. The size cannot be negative and cannot be greater
	    than entries.length. The front cannot be less than 0 or greater than entries.length - 1.
	    
(b) a, d, g
	b, h
	c, f
	e

(c) 1. No. Because the integer returned cannot be changed or to be used to change the values
		   in the class.
	2. Yes. It returns the pointer to the array of String. So client might change the array with
			this pointer.
	3. No. The function is made private so the client cannot call this function directly.
	4. No. String is not mutable so it cannot be changed through any action of the client.
	5. Yes. The returned iterator might have a remove function which changes the inside state.
	6. No. The constructor initialize the object and don't expose the inside codes.
